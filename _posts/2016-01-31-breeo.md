# Company Information

The very early prototype of the smokeless campfire was developed by an Amish gentleman in Holmes County, Ohio several years ago. The team at Breeo Industries continues to support that heritage of work ethic, living simply and caring about the little things in life. We have taken the original smokeless(Patented) idea and applied it to multiple styles of fire pits. All of the products are American Made by Amish and Mennonite craftsman in Ohio and Pennsylvania, ensuring a high level of quality.

Breeo Industries has a goal of reviving the campfire culture in North America. Over the last decade or two, gas logs and other alternatives have gained in popularity due to their convenience. We here at Breeo Industries feel that nothing can replace the ambiance and warmth of a real wood fire. Almost everyone can remember fond campfire memories with family and friends, roasting hotdogs, singing campfire songs, and talking late into the night.
